# morg 'wiki'

_morg_ is a set of scripts that helps set up a local wiki that allows
simple but effective organisation of notes and information that can be
organised hierarchically. It takes advantage of the useful
[pandoc](http://www.pandoc.org) command line program, through
translation of markdown files (which are easier to read in a text editor)
to html files (which allow for ease of navigation between notes and files
in a browser).
