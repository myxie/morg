<h1 id="morg-wiki">morg 'wiki'</h1>
<p><em>morg</em> is a set of scripts that helps set up a local wiki that allows simple but effective organisation of notes and information that can be organised hierarchically. It takes advantage of the useful <a href="http://www.pandoc.org">pandoc</a> command line program, through translation of markdown files (which are easier to read in a text editor) to html files (which allow for ease of navigation between notes and files in a browser).</p>
